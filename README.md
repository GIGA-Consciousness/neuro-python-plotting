# neuro-python-plotting
Various scripts I use to plot using python:

* barplotwithsamples.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook script to plot bars with 90% Confidence Interval error bars and also the subjects points and (optionally) the subjects labels. It just expects as input a txt file with one value per line (one value = one subject). It works particularly well with CONN REX output (results.ROIs.rex.data.txt).
